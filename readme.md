#User Stories

As a new user, I want to be able to provide either an email address or a phone number so that I can choose how Tony's Pizza contacts me.

As a new user, I want to get a token after registration is complete, so that I can use that when ordering pizza.

##Acceptance Criteria

- User can enter either an email address or a phone number for the form to be valid
- Display the token from the Web API service call to the user upon successful registration
- Upon successful registration, the form is hidden and the model is reset
